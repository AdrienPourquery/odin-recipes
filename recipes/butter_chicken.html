        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 large skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces </li>
            <li>1 onion, diced </li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced </li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon curry paste </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons tandoori masala </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garam masala </li>
            <li>15 green cardamom pods </li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
            <li>1 cup low-fat plain yogurt </li>
            <li>salt to taste </li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Warm butter and vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in chicken, onion, and garlic. Cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 10 minutes. 
                Stir in tomato paste, curry paste, curry powder, tandoori masala, and garam masala until no lumps of tomato paste remain.</li>
            <li>Pour mixture into a slow cooker; stir in cardamom pods, coconut milk, and yogurt. Season with salt.</li>
            <li>Cook on High for 4 to 6 hours (or on Low for 6 to 8 hours) until chicken is tender and sauce has reduced to desired consistency. 
                Remove and discard cardamom pods before serving.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong> Tips:</strong></p>
        <p>Pierce a needle with thread through the top of a cardamom pod. Continue with all the cardamom pods, then tie the ends together in a knot, so it looks like a ring. This makes it easy to remove the pods after cooking and prevents someone from biting down on one while eating</p>
